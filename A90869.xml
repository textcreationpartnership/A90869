            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Under the name of the moneth you have the names of ſuch Holy or Feſtival dayes as are fixed in that moneth, together with the day of the moneth upon which they conſtantly fall, ſo under the moneth of <hi>July</hi> you ſhall find <hi>James Apoſt.</hi> 25, which denotes unto you that the 25 day of <hi>July</hi> is St. <hi>Jamſes</hi> day, and ſo of all the reſt.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Let the day of the moneth be given, and let it be required to find the place of the Sun in the Zodiack, to effect which, ſeek the day of the moneth in the Circle of moneths, and right againſt it you ſhall find the ſigne and degree in which the Sun is in the Zodiack. <hi>Example.</hi> Let the day of the moneth given be the 25th. of <hi>July,</hi> ſeek the 25th. of <hi>July</hi> in the Circle of moneths, (which you ſhall find to ſtand at the letter <hi>[a,]</hi> then right againſt it in the Circle of the 12 ſignes you ſhall find about 12 degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> and in that ſigne and degree is the Sun upon the 25th. day of <hi>July,</hi> which 12 degree ſtands at the letter <hi>[b].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If the ſigne in which the Sun is had been given and it were required to find the day of the moneth then look in the Circle of ſignes for the ſigne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and right againſt it you ſhall have the day of the moneth. <hi>Example.</hi> Let the ſigne in which the Sun is, be 12 degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> look in the Circle of Signes for 12 degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> which will be found at the letter <hi>[b]</hi> and right againſt it you ſhall find 25th, day of <hi>July,</hi> which is the day of the moneth required.

            <p>An Iſland is a part of Land, environed, or encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed round about with Water; as <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> together; or, as <hi>Ireland</hi> alone. And theſe are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided, or again divided into Peninſula's, Iſthmus, and Promontories. A Peninſula is almoſt an Iſland; that is to ſay a Tract, or part of Land, which is but almoſt encompaſſed with Water, being joyned to the firm Land by ſome little part of Land, or Iſthmus; as <hi>Morea</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp;c. An Iſthmus is a little narrow neck of Land,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170484:11"/>
which joyneth any Peninſula to the Continent; as the ſtraights of <hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Dariena</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> A Promontory is a high Mountain, which ſhooteth it ſelf into the Sea: the utmoſt end of which is called a Foreland, or Cape; as the Cape of <hi>Good-hope, Cape Verde</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Mount in <hi>England.</hi> There are alſo other real parts of the Earth; as Plains; Vallayes, Hills, Woods, and the like: but theſe are ſo well known by every one, that they need no explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſecond real part of the Globe is Water: which is divided into Ocean, Sea, a Straight, a Creek, or Bay, and Lake.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Ocean is a general collection of Water, which environeth or encompaſſeth the Earth on every ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sea is a part of the Ocean, to which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come, but through ſome ſtraight, as the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneum</hi> ſea, the Black-ſea, the Red-ſea, &amp;c. Now it is plain and certain, that divers and ſundry names have been given to the Sea, as well as to the Earth, taken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Contries and places adjoyning to, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by it; as the <hi>Brittiſh-ſea,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh-ſea,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-ſea,</hi> &amp;c. or from the divers Climates, Situation, or parts of the World: from whence came the North-ſea, the Eaſt-ſea, the Weſt-ſea, the South-ſea, <hi>Mare del Nort, Mare del Zur:</hi> The Sea which floweth between <hi>Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> is called the <hi>Mederiterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum,</hi> or Mid-land Sea, becauſe it lyeth as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the aforeſaid places. She hath ſometimes her name from the colour, as the Red-ſea, (which alſo called <hi>Arabian</hi> Gulf) not that the Water is red, but the Red ſand which lyeth under it, make it to appear ſo. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it takes its name oftentimes from the nature, effects, and events of things: as appears in that which did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170484:11"/>
be fal the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in the Sea between <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Canaries,</hi> or fortunate Iſlands: for they carrying over a great company of Mares, to put in the places they had taken, (which were deſtitnte of them) that they might there increaſe and multiply, and becauſe by tempeſt they were drowned in the Sea: they called it the Gulf of Mares. About the North-pole, it is called the frozen Sea, becauſe it is there almoſt alwayes frozen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Straight is a part of the Ocean, reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in narrow bounds, and opening a way to the ſea, as the Straights of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> and the Straights of <hi>Magella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A Creek or Bay, is a crooked ſhore, thruſting out as it were two arms, to embrace the ſea; as the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Creeks: alſo <hi>Button's</hi> and <hi>Hudſon's</hi> Bay.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Lake is a great Collection, or gathering of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which hath no viſible entercourſe with the ſea: as the Lake of <hi>Lough-Neauh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Dead-ſea</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the <hi>Caſpian-ſea:</hi> though by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the bigneſs of the two laſt, they are called ſeas. And hereunto belong Rivers, Brooks and the like, which are ſo well known by every man, that we will paſs them over without more ado.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the flowing and ebbing of the Sea.</head>
               <p>You muſt know that it is not always alike: for in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places it doth encreaſe for the ſpace of 6 whole hours, and decreaſe as many: but in the Promontory of <hi>Erithrem,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> commonly called <hi>Cabo Roſſo,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth 4 hours, and decreaſeth 8. In divers places it keeps alwayes at one ſtate, without ebbing or flowing.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170484:12"/>
And ſo at the Cape called <hi>Das Palmas,</hi> it runs ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, although by vertue of the firſt <hi>mobile,</hi> or chief moveable, and of the Moon, the whole Sea ſeems to move towards the Weſt: Notwithſtanding, when by interpoſition of the Earth, ſhe is hindred from her natural courſe, it cometh to paſs, that her courſe is variable, not onely in the aforeſaid places, but alſo in many others. For the ſame cauſe it is, that about <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi> the Sea runs ſtill towards the North without any return; and ſo the courſe hath been obſerved to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, according to the diverſity of places. It muſt alſo be obſerved, that the Sea doth move otherwiſe at the full Moon, then it doth when it is but half: for there is more ſtrength in a full light, then in that which is almoſt extinguiſhed. There is alſo a certain place in <hi>Norway,</hi> called <hi>Maelſtroom,</hi> within which the Sea flowing is in ſuch ſort ſwallowed up by a Gulf, that it is never ſeen afterwards. The like is to be ſeen in the <hi>Boddick</hi> Gulf.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170484:12"/>
ſailed through the Sea, which is between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> ſay, that they have often made above 100 Leagues, without ſeeing one fiſh: and contrariwiſe in ther places, there are ſuch abundance to be ſeen, that it is wonderful: which hath been well known by the thoſe who have ſailed towards the North Coaſts of <hi>America;</hi> and above all, towards <hi>Newfound</hi> Land, which for the abundance of fiſh is called <hi>De Baccalos.</hi> Moreover, one would think that Nature hath taken delight, in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting in the Sea, many things which are ſeen on the Earth. For as touching four-footed Beaſts, you ſhall find therein the Elephant, the Hog, the Schel-crab, the Dog, the Calſ, the Horſe, the Cow, and many other the like things. And as for Feathered Fowels, there is the Hawk, the Swallow, and others<hi>:</hi> yea, the very likeneſs and image of man. The ancient Writers, as alſo the late, do likewiſe affirm, That there are Meirmaids in the Sea, which have at ſundry times ſhewed themſelves in divers places, (as <hi>Peter Launy</hi> affirmes) by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of many, (to whom I remit the doubtful Reader.) And finally, the Sea brings forth alſo divers Plants; as Coral, Pearles, Amber, Sponge, and many other things, both delightful and neceſſary for mans uſe.</p>

               <p>The imaginary parts of the Earth, are ſuch, as though not in the Earth, yet muſt be ſuppoſed to be ſo, for the underſtanding of this Science; and are certain Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles going about the Earth anſwerable to them, which the Aſtronomers attribnte to the Heavens: That bigger Line which croſſeth both Planiſpheres, in the Map, ſtraight along in the midſt, dividing (as it were) the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170484:13"/>
World into two halves; that is to ſay, North and South, is called the Equinoctial, Equator, or middle Line; becauſe when the Sun is come thereto, which is on the 11th. of <hi>March,</hi> and 12th. of <hi>September:</hi> the day and night is of equal length over all the World, and this is the great, fixed, and immoveable Circle, which goes round about the Earthly Globe, from Eaſt to Weſt, and paſſeth through <hi>Bornea, Upper-Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Guinea:</hi> as you may ſee in the Map. This Line is full of black and white ſpots, or ſpaces (to the number of 360:) which are called Degrees, and a degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of 60 minutes, and conteins 60 miles; for as much as a minute is accounted a mile.—The uſe hereof is to ſhew the Latitude of any Countrey, Place, or City, (that is) the diſtance of them towards the North or South, from the Equator, which is reckoned on the Meridian, towards either Pole. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have North latitude, that inhabit or dwell between the middle Line, and the North Pole: and thoſe South latitude, who dwell between the Equinoctial, and South Pole.</p>
               <p>The Meridian is a great Circle compaſſing round the Earth, from Pole to Pole, and is that which you ſee in the Circumference of the two Planiſpheres of the Map. But there are many Meridians, according to the divers places in which a Man lives: but the chief and fixed paſſeth through St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> one of the <hi>Azores</hi> Iſles. The uſe of the Meridian is to ſhew the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of any Countrey, Place, or City: Now the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude is the diſtance of it Eaſt or Weſt, from the great and fixed Meridian: and this diſtance, or longitude is meaſured and numbred on the middle Line, or Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by 10, 20, &amp;c. from the great and fixed Meridian,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170484:13"/>
to the numbers of 360, into which the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the Earth is divided, An Example ſhall be this: Look for <hi>England,</hi> and you will ſee that it is a little Eaſt of the ſecond Meridian: then follow that Line to the Equator, and look there as much Eaſtward, as <hi>England</hi> is from the Meridian above, and count or reckon the degrees thereon, from the great and fixed Meridian, to that place, and you will ſee that it is about 22; and this is the longitude of <hi>England:</hi> but then you muſt note, that we mean the middle thereof. All the other ſmall Lines that go through the Map, from North to South, are alſo called Meridians. We will give you an Example, both of the longitude and latitude together. Suppoſe, you would know in what degree of longitude and latitude the middle of <hi>Ireland</hi> is; Firſt, then look for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and you will ſee it is North of the fifth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel: then follow that Line to the Meridian, and you will ſee that it is about 51: Then caſt your eye to the middle of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and you will ſee that it is about 52: Then look towards the Weſt, and you will perceive that it lies ſomewhat Eaſt of the firſt Meridian: Then follow it down to the Equator, and ſo look as much Eaſt there as <hi>Ireland</hi> is above, and you will ſee that the middle thereof is about 52, which is the longitude thereof: ſo that the middle of <hi>Ireland</hi> is about the 52 degree of latitude, and thus you may eaſily find any other place or City. And this may ſerve for a Rule, to know the length and breadth of any Countrey; for as much as every degree is reckoned for 60 miles, as was ſaid before. Thoſe ſmall Lines thwarting or croſſing the Meridian, from Eaſt to Weſt, are called parallels, or equidiſtances, being diſtant one from another 10 deg. towards each Pole, and are for the eaſie and ready
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170484:14"/>
finding out of the latitude of any place from the equator. As for example, look for <hi>England,</hi> and count the parallels or equidiſtances, till you come to the parallel, which is neareſt to it, and you will find them to be 5: Then follow that line to the meridian, and you will ſee the figure ſet thereat is 50: ſo that you will find the latitude, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (for they are both as one) of <hi>England,</hi> from the Equator, towards the North-pole, to be 50 degr. and better: but then this (you muſt note) is the South part of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo in the like manner may you find any other place. But there is another ſort of parallels, which are called <hi>Artificial Parallels,</hi> for that they ſhew the difference of <hi>Artificial Dayes:</hi> the uſe of which, is to ſhew the <hi>Climates.</hi>

The uſe thereof is to ſhew the length and ſhortneſſe of the Day, in all the ſeveral parts of the World. Now under the Equinoctial line and 10 Degrees on North, and as many on the South-ſide thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of 12 hours; but afterwards they increaſe the length of half an hour in every Clime, till they come to 24 hours without night, (and are ſo marked, ſhewed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as you may ſee in the utmoſt Circumference of the Map) which length atteined, they increaſe no more by hours, but by weeks and moneths, until they come to the length of half a year: ſo as there are two ſorts of Climates; that is to ſay, 24 North,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170484:14"/>
and as many South, from the Equator: (touching the names of which, we will refer you to larger Volumes and diſcourſes.) By which it appears, that they who dwell under the ſame Latitude of the Poles, have the ſame length of day and night: But to them on the South of the Equator, the day is ſhorteſt, then with us (on the North) it is at the longeſt; and our Winter is their Summer, and ſo contrariwiſe their Winter is our Summer, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>Of the Winde.</head>
               <p>It is a hot and dry Exhalation drawn into the air by the power of the Sun: and by reaſon of the weight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (being driven down) is carried ſide-long about the Earth: but this muſt be underſtood of general windes, which blow over all the Earth, or at the leaſt ſome great Countries. For there are a ſecond ſort of winds, which are peculiar onely to ſome Countries, and thoſe not very large, which are begot on this manner. It is confeſſed, that in the Globe of the Earth there are wonderful holes, wherein when air aboundeth, (and cannot abide to be ſhut up) findeth ſome little hole, or as it were a mouth, to breathe, or break out at: In (or about) thoſe Countries bloweth vehemently; but that force extendeth not far, for it is like wind that cometh out of Bellows. This winde therefore differeth from the general winds, both in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and quality: for the matter of them is an exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the quality ſuch as the nature of the exhalation, very airy, but not indeed air. There is alſo a third ſort of wind, which is a gentle and cool moving of the air, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from no certain place, yet is felt in the ſhade under trees, but in the open Sun it is not perceived: it cometh whisking ſuddenly, (very pleaſant in the heat of ſummer) and ceaſeth preſently again. This is no wind properly, but a moving of the air by ſome occaſion.</p>
               <p>1. The North wind is cold and dry, but ſerene, clear, wholeſome, and a preſerver of things from corruption: yet through the extremity of cold, it oft-times proves hurtful to flowers, and new-budded fruits. 2. The South wind is hot and moiſt, and by reaſon of its moiſture, it is not only
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170484:17"/>
hurtful to ſeeds and fruits, but to living creatures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets dark and cloudy air, which is for the moſt part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with rain, unleſſe it keeps generally blowing, and then it produceth clearneſſe, but a ſtifling heart, and ſtirs up many diſeaſes, as feavers, peſtilence, and other contagious griefs. 3. The Weſt wind is moiſt, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately watery, and hath many favourable and cheriſhing blaſts: yet ſtireth up both rain and thundrer. 4. The Eaſt wind is very hot, and intemperately dry; yet very pleaſant, pure, and wholeſome: (but chiefly in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) for it preſerves the body ſound, and in winter it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth froſt. Theſe are the four chief, or principal. The ſecondary are,</p>
               <p>1. The North-Eaſt wind is dry and cold, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the temper both of North and Eaſt: it ſtirs up clouds, and ſometimes produceth ſnow. 2.

               <p>1 The EARTH is dry and cold; an Element differing from Air, agreable with Fire, in drineſs: with Water, in coldneſs; and it is more of a dry quality,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170484:21"/>
and leſs of a cold. The Circuit of the Earth is 21600 miles; but the Diameter is 6872: ſo that 3436 will reach the middle.

The Women are not inferiour to, if not before, any other Parts, and they have been of high eſteem amongſt Foreign Nations for their modeſty, though of late much addicted to the light garb of the <hi>French:</hi> and as they are the handſomeſt, ſo are their priviledges the greateſt of any; for it is a by-word with the <hi>Italians,</hi> That if there were a Bridge made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the narrow Seas, all the Women of <hi>Europe</hi> would run into <hi>England;</hi> for here they have the upper-end at the Table; the upper-hand in the ſtreets; the thirds of their Husbands Eſtates; and in a word, it is a Paradiſe for Women. And although their Nobles are many, yet their Powers are limited. The whole Land is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 40 Shires, and thoſe have 6 Judges for the ending of <hi>Controverſies:</hi> two whereof, are to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Juſtice in the chief Town of every Shire twice a year. And although it had but two Univerſities, yet they exceed ten of moſt other Countries. The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues hereof in <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. time, were ſaid to be 40000
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170484:24"/>
Crowns yearly, and improved by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, to a Million more. The Goſpel was firſt preached here by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> which they do ſtill profeſs, and in a good degree keep to, though there be many who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Opinion. Their Religion, at the preſent, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Independency,</hi> becauſe they give liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but the Government <hi>Presbyterial.</hi> From hence is not only ſent Woollen-Cloth, as was ſaid before, but Stuffs, Saffron, Licoriſh, Tin, Lead, Wheat, Barley, and good Beer, (as the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> know full well.) Herein are alſo many Rivers, ſweet Springs, excellent Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, healthful Baths, populous Cities, commodious Havens: and, in a word, there is hardly any Countrey in the Univerſe, (all things conſidered) on which God hath beſtowed larger bounties.</p>
            <p>IRELAND is on all ſides environed with the Sea, and is a moſt fruitful and pleaſant Countrey; the Air temperate, being warmer in Winter, and cooler in Summer, then in <hi>England:</hi> The Soil is fitter for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, then Tillage. Herein are many Rivers and Lakes, which are abundantly ſtored with Fiſh: as alſo Fowl in good plenty, and great ſtore of Cattle; but the breed is leſſe then in <hi>England,</hi> except Grayhounds. The People, (I mean the <hi>Iriſh)</hi> are ſtrong, nimble, haughty, greedy of glory, patient in Cold and Hunger, careleſs of their lives, and leight of belief, much addicted to Cuſtoms; one whereof is, <hi>That they kneel down to the Moon, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to leave them, in as good health as ſhe found them.</hi> One of the many Rarities I will recite, is, 3 Lakes in the Country of <hi>Meath,</hi> not far a ſunder, and have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of Waters, but of ſo different natures, that the Fiſh which are proper to the one, will not live in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Their Government is by one ſupreme Magiſtrate, called the <hi>Lord Deputy;</hi> the profit of the Cuſtom is ſaid
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170484:25"/>
to amount to 30000 <hi>li.</hi> yearly. From hence are ſent Rugs, Mantles, Honey, Herrings, &amp;c. And in brief, Nature hath inriched it beyond moſt others.</p>
            <p>SCOTLAND is ſurrounded with the Sea on all ſides, except on the South, where it is ſeparated from <hi>England,</hi> by the Rivers of <hi>Solway</hi> and <hi>Tweed:</hi> It is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into the High-lands and Low-lands, Northern and Southern: for the moſt part, eſpecially the North, it is ſo barren, that it is hardly able to afford ſuſtenance for the people, were they not patient in hunger and want: Nor hath it much Fruit, nor many Trees: the people for the moſt part holding the Land at the Will of their Landlord, and ſo not encouraged to plant: Their chief Commodities are coorſe Cloth, Hides, Malt, Fiſh, and Sea-Coal.</p>
            <p>WALES is encompaſſed with the Sea, except to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England;</hi> from which it was anciently divided by the River <hi>Wy,</hi> and a Line drawn to the River <hi>Dee:</hi> The whole Countrey is mountainous and barren, ſcarce able to maintain the people, but that its defect is help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Silver Mines, which were of late found out: It hath many Rivers, which afford good ſtore of Fiſh. Their Commodities are Frizes and Cottons; the People much given to paſſion, but ſoon appeaſed.</p>
            <p>The Iſles belonging to <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> are, the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Garnſey, Jerſey, Wight, Orcades, Hebrides, Man, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſey,</hi> and many others; as you may ſee in that new Map of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> called, <hi>The Plain Man's Map;</hi> to which we will refer you.</p>

               <hi>Gibralter;</hi> and on the North with the <hi>Cantabrian</hi> Sea, and ſome part of <hi>France:</hi> The Air is very clear and calm: The People are ſaid to deſcend from <hi>Goths, Moors</hi> and <hi>Jews:</hi> They are proud, melancholy, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, conceited of themſelves, great braggers, very much given to Women, and are exceeding jealous of their Wives. The Women are ſober, and loving both to their Husbands and Friends. The Soyl for the moſt part, is over-grown with Woods, and is very mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or of ſo hot a nature, and ſandy, as not fit for Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; and by reaſon of the ſcarcity of Water, it is unfit for Paſture: Yet in ſome places, it is as fruitful as any part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Their Religion for a long time, hath been that of <hi>Rome;</hi> for ſuch is the cruelty of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Inquiſition, that ſome that are Papiſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to the death. They are, by ſome, reckoned for good Souldiers, not for their valour, but becauſe they are able to endure hardſhip. Their Commodities are Orenges, Lemmons, Marble, Honey, and ſome Mines of Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>PORTUGAL is bounded on the Weſt &amp; South, with the Atlantick Sea: on the Eaſt and North with <hi>Spain.</hi> The Soyl is hilly, and bare of Corn; the Air healthy, the People more ſimple, and plain of behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, than the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> for Religion, they are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, good Seafaring-men, and happy in diſcovering of Foreign Countries. Herein are divers Rivers, of which <hi>Nitinius</hi> is none of the leaſt; for it is ſaid to be Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable with ſmall Veſſels near 100 miles, and is full of Red-Lead. Their chief Commodities are Oyl, Wine, Allom, Honey, Salt-Fiſh, Silk, Marble, Fruit, and ſome Mines of Silver. This as well as the Low-Counrries, did once belong to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>

FRANCE is bounded on the Eaſt with ſome part of the <hi>Low-Countries, Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy:</hi> On the Weſt, with the <hi>cantabrian</hi> Sea, and ſome part of <hi>Spain;</hi> On the South with the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; and on the North, with the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Sea. It is very fruitful in Wine, Salt, Beeves, Corn, Prunes, Woods, Nuts, Coral, Skins, Canvas, Siſers, Cards, and moſt kind of Mercery Ware: Having many illuſtrious Cities, exceedingly well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled; as <hi>Paris, Roan</hi> and others. Neither can it be wanting in Fiſh: for, beſides the Seas here, are many Rivers, Ponds and Lakes. The People are ſaid to be hot of nature, leight of carriage, curious of Palate, and therefore not able to endure hardſhip; and ſo, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, not good Souldiers, but for a ſpir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The condition of the common people is miſerable, for that they have great and uncertain Reſts ſet by the Landlords (for the Husbandman is Tenant at their Will:) and becauſe they have great Taxes laid upon them.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Religion is ſaid to be firſt planted here by ſome of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Diſciples; but at this time, they are accounted Papiſts, yet are they divided; for in the year 1560. there were ſaid to be 1250 <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> and it is conceived, that they are much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, notwithſtanding the Maſſacres they have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>ITALY is bounded on all ſides with the Sea, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome part where it bordereth on <hi>France;</hi> and on the North, where it is ſeparated by the Mountains, called the <hi>Alpes,</hi> from <hi>Germany.</hi> It is as pleaſant and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Countrey, as any in <hi>Europe,</hi> and yields not onely Wine and Corn, but Silks, Sattens, Velvets, Grograins, Raſh, Bombaſus, Taffeties, Wire of gold and ſilver, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, Galls, Drinking and Looking-Glaſſes of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:170484:26"/>
The people are witty, but deceitful, malicious, hot, and laſcivious; in their Houſes ſumptuous, at Table neat, in expences thrifty, and civil of carriage, unleſs to their Wives, of whom they are extream jealous, (and haply not without cauſe) and will permit them liberty of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with few or none, though they are ſaid to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly modeſt: but the Proverb is, <hi>That they are Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies at the Door, Saints in the Church, Angels in the Streets, Goats in the Garden, Sirens in the Windows, and Devils in the Houſe:</hi> Moſt of them uſe painting, moſt wickedly ſaying, <hi>That if God make them tall and plump, they will make themſelves fair.</hi> The Language of both Sex is very courtly and fluent. They have twice given Laws to the powerful part of the then known World; once by their Valour, and once by their Wit: By which laſt, they have ſubjected great part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to the Pope. And as their Language is much changed, ſo is their Religion; for (as ſome ſay) the Goſpel was firſt preached here by St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and as others ſay, by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> but one quaering the truth hereof, thus ſaith;</p>
            <l>

that ſhe may compare with any. The Soil is fruitful in Corn and Wine: it hath many Navigable Rivers, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with plenty of Fiſh, moſt excellent Fountains, and hot Baths, Mines of Copper, Lead, Tin, Iron, and ſome of Silver and Gold. It hath many learned men, very skilful in all Sciences, and mechanical Arts. They were the Inventers of Gun-powder, and of the Noble Art of Printing. Their Women are of a good Complexion, but much given to eating and drinking, and ſo apt to fatneſs. The Title of the Father deſcends to all the Children: ſo that the Sonne of a Lord, is a Lord, which verifies the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>That the Dukes and Lords of</hi> Germany, <hi>the Dons of</hi> Spain, <hi>the Nobility of</hi> Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>the Monſieurs of</hi> France, <hi>the Knights of</hi> Naples, <hi>the Lairds of</hi> Scotland, <hi>the Biſhops of</hi> Italy, <hi>and the younger Brethren of</hi> England, <hi>make a poor Company.</hi> In Religion they are reckoned for Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>HOLLAND (or the 17 Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countries)</hi> is counted a part of <hi>Germany:</hi> the Air is now more wholſom then formerly: for through the induſtry of the people, it is much drained: And in it are many Rivers, (as the <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moſella, Moſa</hi> and the <hi>Eſcant)</hi> plentifully ſtored with Fiſh. Here is alſo plenty of Corn and Cattle, many great Towns rich and well peopled.

They perfected the Marriners Compaſs, and have many Pilots well practiſed in the Art of Navigation.

               <p>ICE-LAND is ſituated, for the greater part, under the Arctick Circle, as you may ſee in the Map ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the abundance of Ice unto which it is ſubject, being conſtantly frozen for about 8 moneths, and is ſo vehemently cold with the North wind, that it affords neither Corn nor Trees, except <hi>Juniper:</hi> yet there is graſſe in good plenty, as alſo Horſes, Oxen, and Kine without horns, ſheep, white Ravens, white Faulcons, white Beares, and white Hares; but the people are ſaid to live on that which Nature gives them, without help of Art, more then the making of Butter and Cheeſe. They uſe neither Phyſitian nor Phyſick; and yet it is reported, that many of them live to 150 years of age: few of them but have ſome familiar ſpirit. They have Neceſſaries brought to them by the Merchant, who hath given him in return thereof, ſometimes Beeves and Muttons; but more ordinarily Brimſton, Skins, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Butter, and Fiſh chiefly. And notwithſtanding the cold condition of this Countrey, it is full of heats and fires under the ground, occaſioned (as is moſt probable) by thoſe veins of Brimſton on which the Hills ſtand.

The Women are of a brown complexion, and uſe painting, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in favour with their Husbands: for if once they

Both Sexes, for the moſt part, apply themſelves in their habits, to the State under which they live: Such as live under the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to theirs: and thoſe under the <hi>Turks</hi> to theirs.

St. <hi>Jude</hi> is ſaid to preach the Goſpel here firſt, and it was ſo well rooted, that it could not be plucked up, though cruelly perſecuted by the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and therefore he endeavoured to corrupt it: By which means, the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> very much increaſe: They differ much from other Chriſtians. In contracting Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they never ſee their Sweet-hearts; but, hearing a good report of her, deal with her Parents for her; and having agreed, they meet in the Chancel of the Church, wherein there is a partition with a hole in it: The Bridegroom and his Friends ſtand on the one ſide; and the Bride and hers on the other. Then the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bids the Bridegroom put his hand through the hole in the partition, and take his Bride by the hand; which being done, the Mother of the Bride, with a ſharp-pointed Inſtrument, pricketh the Bridegrooms hand with great eagerneſs: If, when he feels the ſmart, he let her hand go, they rake it for a ſign that he will not love her; but if he wring her till ſhe cry, they are glad that they have ſo well beſtowed her.</p>

            <p>The people generally are of a ſquare ſtature, broad and groſs faces, hollow-eyed, thin beards, thick lips, flat noſes, and ſwarfie of complexion; occaſioned not by the heat of the Sun, but by their own naſtineſs.

            <p>The women are ſuitable to the men, ſcorning or wanting Ornaments, to ſet them out; or when they do, they ſeldom have better then Feathers, Copper, or ſuch like Trifles.

            <p>The making of Guns alſo, is of more antiquity with them, then with us, and they make Waggons that ſail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Land, as Ships over the Sea. They are wiſe and politick, but extream jealous of their Wives, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to go abroad, nor ſit at the Table, if any ſtrangers be there, although the poor Women be civil, and fearful of giving offence; and do paint more to keep themſelves in their Husbands affections, then out of wantonneſs: moſt of them have very little feet; and to effect this, they bind them up hard from their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: in their Dreſs they are neat, and in Apparel coſtly.</p>
            <p>In Religion, (if it deſerve the name thereof) Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and they ſay there was one <hi>Taine,</hi> who created <hi>Panzon,</hi> and <hi>Panzona,</hi> whoſe Poſterity remained Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand years: but then for their wickedneſs being

deſtroyed, <hi>Taine</hi> created <hi>Lutizam,</hi> who had two Horns; from the Right, came Man; and from the Left, Woman: and ſuch notorious Idolaters are they, that they do not only worſhip the Sun, Moon, and other Idols, but the very Devil, becauſe he ſhould do them no hurt: yet do conceive, that the Soul dieth not with the Body, but is capable of puniſhment or reward, according to their works done in this life.</p>
            <p>The whole Countrey is ſaid to be divided into 15 Kingdoms, or Provinces; each having a peculiar Prince, but all ſubject to their great King, who is able to bring into the Field 300000 Foot, and 200000 Horſe: it hath many Cities well peopled; but of the greatne's and goodneſs of the City <hi>Paquin</hi> (where the King is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident) things are written almoſt incredible. Their chief Commodities are Mines of Gold, Copper, Iron, Steel, pretious Stones and Pearls.

The People are of a ſwarfie Complexion, but ſtrong, tall, ingenuous, free from fraud, and punctual of their word: (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had need; for they lend without Witneſs, or ſealing of Bonds.) Their Women are not much fairer then the men, and wear their hair long and looſe, but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170484:38"/>
covered with a thin Vail: their Ears and Noſes they hang with Rings and Jewels, according to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. Their men are allowed many Wives, which they buy of their Parents for a yoak of Oxen. He that deprives another of any member, is not only to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in the ſame, but his Hand is to be cut off. But if an Artificer, or Tradeſman be deprived of an Eye, or Hand; he that cauſed it is to die for it. And of ſuch eſteem are the Tradeſmen, that they are free from Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and have Corn allowed them by the King (which is no ſmall encouragement to them.)

more fire than at other times. The Day and Night, for the greateſt part of the year, little differ. The Soil is very fruitful, and doth not only produce Fruits, Plants, and Hearbs; but hath good Paſture alſo, in which are bred many Herds of Cattle, large Flocks of Sheep, Stags, Goats, Conies, Hares, and Elephants ſo large, that their Teeth weigh 200 pounds; and Serpents of that bigneſs, that they eat a whole Deer at once. Here are Fowl alſo in great plenty, both Tame and Wild. The people are ſaid to have Shambles of mans fleſh, as we have for meat; and they kill their Children in the birth, to avoid the trouble of breeding them; preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Nation with ſtollen brats from the adjacent Countries.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>Zanguebar</hi> is low and Fenny, and much overflown with unruly Rivers, and ſo full of Forreſts and Woods, that for want of Air it is very peſtilent. The people are black of Complexion &amp; very much given to South-ſaying; indeed Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>Cafraia</hi> (ſo much of it as is diſcovered) is ſaid to be plentifully ſtored with Heards of Cattle, Flocks of Sheep great ſtore of Foxes, Deers, Pheaſants, Partridges, Geeſe, Ducks, and other Beaſts and Fowl: Alſo the Hills are as it were mingled with graſſie Vallies, ſtored with Forreſts and Woods: and, in brief, all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the uſe of man, were it better ſtored with Corn. And pitty it is, that the people of ſo good a Countrey, ſhould be ſo baſe and brutiſh, that men can hardly ſay, whether the people generally may be thought to be men in the Skins of Beaſts, or Beaſts in the ſhapeand likeneſs of men.</p>
               <p>In this Countrey ſtands the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the Sea is alwayes dangerous: it hath been ſo, eſpecially to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in omuch that one was angry with God, that he ſuffered the <hi>Engliſh Hereticks</hi>

               <hi>A View of AMERICA, (or, as we may call it,</hi> The New World; <hi>for that it was laſt diſcovered.)</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AMERICA, or, <hi>The New World</hi> (ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it was laſt diſcovered, and from its bigneſs) <hi>Christopher Columbus</hi> was the firſt that opened a gap into it. Next to him, <hi>Americus Veſputius,</hi> who gave it that name. <hi>Ferdinando Magellanicus</hi> firſt attempted, and found out the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the South-Sea Limits which beareth his Name. Our own Heroicks, Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Noble <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> followed, and added to what was done by them: <hi>Davis</hi> and <hi>Forbiſher,</hi> two <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> went fair for a Paſſage round, and have left their Names behind them, in the North part thereof, as is expreſſed in the Map. This <hi>New World,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> hath many Mines, in ſome whereof (as it is reported) they hardly find ſo much Earth, as Gold, which they exchange for Axes, Hammers, Knives, and ſuch like Tools: for want of which, they (formerly) made their Boats, or Canoes, with the force of fire. There are ſuch multitudes of Bulls and Kine, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> kill thouſands year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, onely for their Tallow and Hides: It is alſo very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170484:48"/>
plentiful in Spices and Fruits, and divers ſtrange Beaſts and Birds, which other parts are ignorant of: as Deer without Horns; a kind of Hare reſembling a Cat in its Tayl, a Wont in its feet, and under his Chin is a little bag, which Nature hath taught him to make a Store-houſe: for having filled his belly, he reſerveth the reſt therein: And here is a Bird ſo big, that it will ſeize on a Calf, or Sheep, and devour it. Here is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo as little, called <hi>Tomineo,</hi> of all colours, yet hardly bigger then a Butter-fly, and is as ſweet as the <hi>Nightingale</hi> in note.</p>
            <p>The People are indifferent fair, (though a good part of it lyeth in the ſame Parallel, as the Land of <hi>Negroes:</hi> ſo that it appeares, that the heat of the Sun is not the ſole and onely cauſe of blackneſs) and it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that theſe people came firſt out of <hi>Tartary,</hi> (not only by reaſon of their rude and barbarous manners, but alſo) becauſe <hi>America</hi> is parted from thence by a very ſmall ſtraight; as appeares in the Map, to which I refer you. But from whomſoever theſe People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, they have ſurely been here many Ages, which clearly appeares, becauſe no part was found without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, by any of the firſt Diſcoverers; though now much diminiſhed by the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who killed them like Beaſts, not ſuffering them to enjoy their Natural Birth-right, though there was Land and Riches enough, both for the one and the other.</p>
            <p>But in our Deſcription of this <hi>Weſtern Hemiſphere,</hi> we ſhall ſpeak to it, as it is now known and diſcovered in the ſeveral Countries, and then of Its Iſlands. And this we would have you note, that when we ſay the People, you are to underſtand the old and Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, except we expreſs the contrary. We will begin in the North part, becauſe that is the upper-part of our Map, and the Cardinal, or chief Point, of the Wind or Compaſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:170484:48"/>
As for the furtheſt North of all, we can ſay little, onely that ſome ſmall Diſcoveries have been made by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſeveral parts: as appeares by the ſeveral Names given thereto; as <hi>New-North Wales, New-South-Wales, New-Brittain, Buttons-Bay, Hudſons Straights,</hi> and the like, which you may ſee in the Map.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſtotiland</hi> is but little known; and therefore this is all that we can ſay of it, That it is very cold, yet is ſaid to have divers Mettals and Fruits, neceſſary for the life of the People, whoſe Cloathing is the Skins of Beaſts, and Sea-Calves; Labourers Land is like to it, and they are accounted both as one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Terra-corterealis</hi> was firſt diſcovered by <hi>Sebastian Cabot, Anno</hi> 1499. (at the charge of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7th) who found good ſtore of great Stags, White Beares, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Cod-fiſh: but returning home, (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preparation for a War with <hi>Scotland,)</hi> nothing was done in further Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Canada,</hi> on the North of <hi>New-France,</hi> all we can ſay of it, is, that the <hi>French</hi> have taken ſome poſſeſſion hereof, and that it affords good ſtore of Wild-Beaſts and Fiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-France</hi> hath plenty of Stags; Hares, Conies, Beares, Foxes, and Fiſh. The people are rude, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and are allowed two or three Wives apiece. The Women labour more then the men, both in digging the ground, and in Fiſhing; and are ſo conſtant, that they will not marry after the death of their Husbands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New Scotland,</hi> containing that part to <hi>New-France,</hi> which was by King <hi>James</hi> called <hi>Cady,</hi> in his Grant to Sir <hi>William Alexander,</hi> 1621. But he, for want of meanes, ſold it to the <hi>French.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Norumbega,</hi> the ſoil is fruitful, and the Air of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different temper: the men are given much to Hunting, and the women love their Husbands well: for until
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170484:49"/>
the death of their Husbands be revenged, (if at any time they be killed) they will neither eat fleſh, nor marry.</p>

               <hi>New-England,</hi> (now come we to have the Countries better diſtinguiſhed, that they may be diſcerned in the Map, for thereunto we refer you) hath on the South-Weſt <hi>New-Netherland,</hi> on the North-Eaſt <hi>Norumbega:</hi> The reſt, either borders on the Sea, or is not well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. The Air is much like to that of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſoil fruitful, in the Natural Commodities; as alſo in thoſe that were carried from <hi>England.</hi> It affords great ſtore of Wood, Deer, Fruit, Swans, Ducks, Geeſe, Partridge, Pidgeons, and the like. But the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are Amber, rich Furs, Iron, Pitch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>New-Netherland</hi> hath on the South-Weſt <hi>Virginia,</hi> and on the North-Eaſt <hi>New-England.</hi> The Air is good, and the ſoil fruitful, abounding with Nuts and Wild-Grapes, and is within the <hi>Hollanders</hi> juriſdiction. Their Woods are ſtored with Deer, their Plains with Fowl, and their Rivers with Fiſh. They have alſo Grain, Hemp, and Flax, in good plenty. The people are fickle, yet true to them that truſt them; and did uſe Bows and Arrows, until the <hi>Dutch</hi> furniſhed them with Arms, and ſhewed them how to uſe them; but they were the firſt that felt the ſmart. Their Religion is groſs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for they worſhip the Devil, by the name of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neto.</hi>

            <p>The People are crafty and inconſtant, for the moſt part full limb'd and tall, wearing an Apron, and a looſe Garment, and paint their bodies with horrid ſhapes

            <p>The People are of a big ſtature, and go naked, except their ſecret parts, which they cover with ſome skins. They have many <hi>Hermaphrodites,</hi> which they put to all kind of drudgery. And herein are divers ſorts of Woods; as Bay-Trees, Cypreſs, Cedars, Oaks, and the like. Alſo wild and tame Beaſts; with ſeveral ſorts of Fruits, and ſome Mines of Gold and Silver.</p>

               <hi>New-Albion</hi> lieth on the Weſt of <hi>California,</hi> and was firſt diſcovered by Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who gave it that name in honour of <hi>England,</hi> which was once call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Albion:</hi> But becauſe it lieth at ſuch a diſtance from thence, (that little or no benefit could be returned), it hath been neglected.

are any more expert in refining Mettals, or making of their Feather-Pictures, at which they will ſit a whole day touching and trying, how they may beſt fit each Feather to the place aſſigned. The Countrey affords plenty of Citrons, Pomgranates, Cherries, and other <hi>European</hi> Fruits; many Silver and Braſſe Mines, but few of Gold or Iron, all of them mixt with Lead; good plenty of Beaſts and Birds, both tame and wild: alſo Fiſh, and Bees without flings, breed here in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. But there is a kind of Fly, or Gnat, which doth offend the Inhabitants. Herein alſo is a Tree which is planted, and dreſt as a Vine, which is reported to have 40 ſeveral ſorts or kinds of Leaves, fit for divers uſes: for they make of them Mantles, Shooes, Paper, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things. From the top comes a juice like Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup; which if purified, becomes Sugar; if boyled, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And there is a Mountain called <hi>Propocampeth,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which ſends out ſtreams of fire like Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and another in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Guatimalia,</hi> which caſteth forth two ſtreams of fire: the one of black Pitch, and the other of red.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guatimalia</hi> is bounded on the South with <hi>Caſtella del Oro,</hi> or <hi>Golden Caſtle;</hi> on the North-Weſt with <hi>New-Spain;</hi> and the reſt with the Sea, as appeares in the Map. It is divided into theſe ſix Provinces.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Guatimalia,</hi> ſpecially ſo called, is mountainous, but wanteth not Rivers; by reaſon whereof, it hath not onely good plenty of Fiſh, but much good Paſture, well ſtored with Cattle; nor is it barren in Maize, Wheat, and other Proviſion; plenty of Cotton-Wooll, many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries Drugs, ſome Balſoms, and good Sulphure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hundura</hi> is full of Hills and Valleys, fruitful in Maize and Wheat; but not much Campaign: very rich in Paſtures, by reaſon of the overflowing of their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. The people are ſo idle, that they had rather feed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170484:50"/>
on Roots, then labour to till the ground.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Chiapa</hi> is not very fit for moſt kind of Fruits, nor Corn; the Trees are bigger then in other places, as Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, Cedars, Pines, and Oaks, and whole Woods of Walnuts; but they not ſo big as in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is full of venomous Creatures; of which the Snakes are none of the leaſt for offence nor greatneſs, ſome of them being reported to be twenty foot in length. Many of their Trees do not onely afford Rozen, and ſome pretious Gums; but alſo ſome, whoſe leaves being dryed to a Powder, make a good Plaiſter for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerating Sores.

The people are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, high-minded, and revengeful, accuſtomed to uſe poyſoned Arrows, which they venome with Snakes bloud, and other mixtures. They have many Wives, which they proſtitute to the <hi>Piacos,</hi> or Prieſt, for the firſt nights lodging. They alſo put ſtrange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours on their bodies inſtead of garments; and like black Teeth ſo well, that they take great pains to make them ſo. And are ſingular from others, not onely in fencing their Ground or Orchard with a Cotton-thread as high as the middle, with an Opinion, that whoſoever goes under, over, or breaks it, ſhall die immediately; but alſo in feeding on Spiders, Horſe-Leeches, Worms, Graſhoppers, and the like.</p>

            <p>The People are without any ſetled Government, though they acknowledge ſome Superiority in the chief parts. The Richeſt, who have two or three Wives a piece; and the poorer, who have but one, are alike jealous, and if they take them in Adultery, they beat out their brains without more ado. Their Wives (but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the eldeſt) they uſe as ſervants<hi>:</hi> and ſolemnize their Funerals with a ſtrange Feaſt; for the men drink and ſing, and the Women houl. Their Accounts and Reckonings they keep by a bundle of ſticks, which they either increaſe or diminiſh, as they have occaſion. The Countrey is divided into theſe three parts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Guiana</hi> (ſpecially ſo called) is ſo fruitful, that on the ſhrubs grow plenty of Cotton, Sugar-canes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out planting, and Tobacco to nine handfuls long. Their Fields are well ſtored with Beaſts, which they call <hi>Moyres,</hi> (in uſe and ſhape reſembling Kine, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horns) their Woods with Veniſon, and their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with Fiſh. They make their Bread and Drink of a Plant called <hi>Caſſavi;</hi> and a great part of their Food is Fiſh, which they intoxicate with a ſtrong-ſcented Wood, and ſo take them up, while they are floating on the top of the Water.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Oronoque</hi> is very rich and pleaſant, conſiſting of large Plains, adorned with unknown Plants and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſometimes Hills intermingled, which are (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be) furniſhed with Mines of Silver and Gold, the Foreſts with Beaſts and Fowl, and the Rivers with Fiſh<hi>:</hi> ſo that no Countrey in all <hi>America,</hi> can compare with this for abundance of Riches.</p>

3. <hi>Rio de las Amazones,</hi> or the River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> though in ſome places it be dry, and barren; yet in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very fruitful, and full of large Woods: wherein are moſt ſorts of Trees, which are found in <hi>America:</hi> Amongſt the reſt, here is one peculiar to this place, which they call <hi>Too-ock,</hi> of a very large Bulk, and the Fruit as big as a mans head; ſo that when it is ripe, the people dare not go into the Woods without ſome ſtrong ſhelter, for fear it ſhould beat out their brains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-Granada</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt with <hi>Guiana,</hi> on the Weſt with <hi>Mare Del Zur;</hi> on the South the Countries not yet diſcovered, and on the North with <hi>Caſtella Del Oro.</hi> It is generally full of Woods, and hath good Paſture in ſome parts; wherein are many Cattle, ſome Corn, Mines of Gold, and other Mettals, but not ſo good. And here groweth the Wood <hi>Guatican,</hi> good for the <hi>French Pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Air hereof is much alike, both in Winter and Summer, the People tall and ſtrong of body, and given much to dancing and ſinging.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peru</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt, with a great ridge of Mountains called <hi>Andes,</hi> on the Weſt with <hi>Mare Del Zur,</hi> on the South with <hi>Chile,</hi> and on the North with ſome part of <hi>New-Granada.</hi> It affords very little Maize or Wheat, ſo that the Inhabitants live moſt on Roots, yet they have ſtore of a kind of ſheep, (which they call <hi>Pacos)</hi> as big as a ſmall breed of Horſes, but in taſte as pleaſant as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mutton, and not inferiour for nouriſhment; nor are they onely of good uſe for their fleece and fleſh, but alſo to carry burthens; and ſo well they know their own ſtrength, that if they are overladen, no blows will make them go, till their burthen be lightned. Herein are alſo a multitude of Beaſls, like
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170484:53"/>
wild Goats. And though the great Riches of this Countrey be in the never-fading Mines of Gold and Silver, yet Tobacco is no ſmall profit to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The people are ignorant of Letters, but well skild in ſuch Weapons as they had been uſed to. Of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in Warre, and fearleſs of death, prompt thereto by an old conceit, that in the other World they ſhall eat, drink, and love Women: And therefore divers times at the Burials of great perſons (who were attended on in this life) they uſe to kill and bury one or more of his ſervants with him, to wait upon him in the other World. This Countrey is of a vaſt length, but the breadth not anſwerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chile</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt with ſome unknown Countries; on the Weſt with the <hi>Pacifick</hi> Sea, or <hi>Mare del Zur;</hi> on the South with the Straights of <hi>Magellani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> and on the North with that part of <hi>Peru,</hi> called the Deſart of <hi>Alacama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It lyeth almoſt wholly between the Straights of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanica,</hi> and the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and therefore in the South temperate-Zone<hi>:</hi> and yet (as ſome ſay) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream cold, inſomuch that ſome are frozen to death, and hardned like Marble. And though the Midland be mountainous and barren: yet towards the Sea it is very fruitful in Maize and Wheat, and hath very good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, ſtored with Cattle, plenty of Gold, Silver, and Honey. The people are of a large ſtature, and white complexion.</p>
            <p>The Straights of <hi>Magellan</hi> were ſo called from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanus,</hi> who firſt diſcovered them: Their breadth is very unequal; for in ſome places, it is 5 or 10 miles broad; in ſome 2 or 3, &amp; in the narroweſt but one. There are in all 3 ſeveral Straights, which heretofore they were clear of. The firſt of which is moſt dangerous, becauſe it ebbeth and floweth with violent ſwiftneſs. The ſecond
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170484:53"/>
is bad enough, though leaſt dangerous. The third is ſaid to be of that nature, that let a man ſteer his courſe which way he will, the Wind will be ſtill againſt him. And therefore it is no marvel, that <hi>Magellanus,</hi> when he had paſt them, and got into the main Ocean, called it the <hi>Pacifick,</hi> or <hi>Peaceable Sea.</hi>

It hath ſome veins of Gold and Silver, Mines of Braſs &amp; Iron, Monkies &amp; Stags in abundance. I need not ſay that here are good ſtore of Tigers, Lions, and ſuch like Creatures; a few of them being too many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Braſile</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt with the Main <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> on the Weſt with ſome unknown Countries, on the South with <hi>Paraguay,</hi> and on the North with ſome part of <hi>Guiana,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean. It is very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in moſt places, were it not for the abundance of rain which doth often fall: yet Sugar-canes grow here in great plenty, and a kind of Wheat which is alwayes growing, and continually ripe; for when ſome is ripe, others bloſſom. And here is a certain Plant called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piba,</hi> the vertue of which is known to the very Beaſts: for if they are bit by any venomous Creature, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to it for cure.</p>
            <p>The people are the Monſters of Nature, being mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and barbarous: for when they get the body of a fat man, they (gather a company together, and) roſt him, making a jovial Banquet therewith. They are ſaid to worſhip no God at all, but adore the Riſing-Sun, and believe the immortality of the Soul.</p>

He ended his ſermon in the mount, reproved raſh judgment, forbids to caſt holy things to dogs, exhorts to praiers, to enter in at the ſtraight gate, to beware of falſe prophets, not to be hearers but doers of the word, likewiſe men who build on the rock and not on the ſand.</p>
